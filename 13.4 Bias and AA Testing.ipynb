    "People are less likely to be looking at or buying bathing suits in February than in May because it is cold in most places in February and warming up and approaching summer and vacation season in May. It will also depend on the geographic location the advertisments are being sent to and how warm it is (or ever gets) at the moment the advertisement is sent. In this design you won't be able to tell if it was the change in the advertisement or the change in the weather that made people buy or not buy the swimsuits advertised. The age group, gender, and affordability of the product/socio-economic status of the targeted customers are also important factors to condsider."
