1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

SELECT t.duration, w.events
FROM trips t
JOIN weather w
ON w.zip = t.zip_code
WHERE events = 'Rain'
ORDER by duration DESC
LIMIT 3

2. Which station is full most often?

SELECT station_id, COUNT(1)
FROM status
WHERE docks_available = 0
GROUP by station_id 
ORDER by count DESC
LIMIT 1

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT t.start_station, s.dockcount, COUNT (*)
FROM stations s
JOIN trips t
ON s.name = t.start_station
GROUP by t.start_station, s.dockcount
ORDER by s.dockcount DESC

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

SELECT t.start_date::date, MAX(t.duration) as max_duration
FROM trips t
JOIN weather w
ON w.date::date = t.start_date::date
WHERE events = 'Rain'
GROUP by t.start_date::date
ORDER by max_duration DESC
