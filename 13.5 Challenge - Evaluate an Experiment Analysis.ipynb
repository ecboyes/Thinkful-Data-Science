    "**1. The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.**\n",

    "**2. In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.**\n",

When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to \"opt in\" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.**\n",

    "The people who opt in vs the people who don't opt in to the data collection could raise some sort of bias on the information reported. Those who opt in could be more likely to up their level of physical activity and those who don't could be more likely to not up their level of physical activity. For an accurate result the fitness app might consider making the data sharing mandatory in order to use the app."

She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.**\n",

    "It is possible that the students who took version B are smarter or were more well prepared than the other students or that they were all grouped in the same area and cheated off of one another. To get a more accurate result the teacher could make all three versions with the same questions but just put them in a different order so it is harder to cheat or seat students far enough away from each other so they can't cheat in the first place. The results may also have to do with the test versions all being grouped together and the students' arrival times to class. For a more accurate result the three versions should be shuffled randomly."
