Why use dependent groups? Come up with a few scenarios where getting repeated measures from the same people would be beneficial. Summarize them in your notebook and discuss with your mentor.

We use dependent groups if we want to test before and after on the same group.  For example, we can test participants' eyesight (dependent variable) when wearing two different types of glasses (independent variable), or vice versa, testing participants' eyesight using the same type of glasses.
